for first time execution, make sure you run "npm install" inside this directory
to run execute "node app.js > log.txt &"

troubleshooting: 
make sure you have nodejs installed
make sure you have a valid PORT environment variable declared or forward and use port 8081
to check for errors, view log.txt. if none are present there, check the terminal for crashes
